# Somali Duplex Dashboard

Somali Duplex is a Somali text-to-speech research and data pipeline. Its goal is
to build a model that learns Somali pronunciation, phrasing, prosody, and
natural speaker characteristics from authorised native Somali recordings paired
with accurate Somali transcripts.

This repository is the Plotly Dash interface for exploring that work. The
dashboard is intended to make the corpus and training journey legible: what
audio has been collected, where it is in the processing pipeline, how much
verified material is available, and how model experiments perform.

## Project goal

The target is not English speech delivered with a Somali accent. It is a model
that can turn written Somali into clear, natural Somali speech. The project
uses a pretrained multilingual speech model as a starting point, then adapts
it with clean Somali speech and transcript pairs. A corpus of roughly 100
hours is a useful first target; larger, well-reviewed corpora support stronger
quality and broader voice coverage.

### 1. Collection and preparation

Recordings must be Somali-language material that the project is authorised to
process and train on. The preferred sources are clean, intelligible speech with
reliable transcripts: studio podcasts, narration, and formal broadcast speech
are useful complements when their speakers and usage rights are understood.

Raw recordings are segmented with Silero VAD, then processed in one local pass
with DeepFilterNet 3 and loudness normalisation. Final data is published as
mono, 24 kHz, 16-bit lossless FLAC clips with `metadata.json`. Temporary VAD
WAV files are discarded. The processing job skips already-complete sources and
refuses partial or conflicting output, protecting dataset integrity.

### 2. Transcripts and review

Each final clip needs a transcript that matches what was actually spoken. The
project can review transcript tasks in Label Studio, which serves source FLAC
files alongside the corresponding CosyVoice transcript data. Audio, text,
speaker attribution, and splits should be checked before a clip becomes
training data.

Timing information can also improve phrasing. The optional pause-alignment
workflow derives punctuation from real word timestamps without changing the
audio or rewriting Somali words. It uses normal punctuation such as commas,
periods, question marks, and ellipses—never unsupported pause tags—and stages
all edits for audit and human review before building a new dataset version.

### 3. Model adaptation

The planned base model is `FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512`. Somali text
tokenizes losslessly in its existing tokenizer, but that alone does not prove
Somali pronunciation quality. The model must learn Somali speech patterns from
the reviewed corpus.

The first fine-tuning experiment fully adapts CosyVoice's LLM and Flow
modules, while keeping the HiFT/HiFi-GAN vocoder frozen. This focuses training
on Somali text-to-speech mapping, timing, prosody, and acoustics while
preserving stable 24 kHz waveform synthesis. Training belongs on a Linux CUDA
machine; this Mac workspace is used for data work, inspection, and inference.

### 4. Evaluation and promotion

Every candidate model is compared with the base model on a held-out Somali
test set. Evaluation combines transcript fidelity, native-speaker
pronunciation review, naturalness and pause quality, speaker similarity, and
waveform checks for clipping, noise, or instability. A checkpoint is promoted
only when it improves Somali intelligibility without materially degrading voice
quality.

## Dashboard scope

The Dash application is the reporting layer for Somali Duplex. As the data
products are connected, it can present collection and processing status,
duration and speaker coverage, transcription-review progress, dataset-version
comparisons, and evaluation results. It is deliberately separate from the
audio-processing and training jobs: the dashboard observes the pipeline rather
than modifying raw recordings or checkpoints.

### Omar dataset analysis

The `/dataset` page reports a complete scan of the processed Omar transcript
tree: corpus hours, timed-word coverage, WPM distribution, low/medium/high pace
bands, pause statistics, source-level variation, technical FLAC compliance,
and the punctuation-normalization audit. Rebuild its checked analysis artifacts
with:

```bash
cd /Users/mali/ai/somali-duplex-plotly
.venv/bin/python scripts/analyze_omar_dataset.py
```

The analyzer writes one row per WPM-eligible clip to `data/omar_wpm.csv` and an
aggregate report to `data/omar_dataset_summary.json`. Audio-event-only JSON
records remain part of total corpus hours but are excluded from pace labeling.

## Run locally

Activate the project environment and start Dash from this repository:

```bash
conda activate "Somali Duplex"
cd /Users/mali/ai/somali-duplex-plotly
python main.py
```

Dash prints the local address when it starts. In development, it normally
serves on `http://127.0.0.1:8050`.
